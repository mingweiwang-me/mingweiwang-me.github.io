üëãüëãHi! I am Mingwei Wang (ÁéãÈì≠‰ºü).
I am currently working as an assistant professor at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). I received my PhD from [the School of Management and Economics at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](https://www.mgmt.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof.Dr. Decui Liang](https://www.mgmt.uestc.edu.cn/jsnry.jsp?urltype=news.NewsContentUrl&wbtreeid=1020&wbnewsid=12401). As a visiting PhD student, I joined [the University Research Priority Program on "Social Networks" at the University of Zurich(UZH)](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/market-research.html) in Switzerland from 2021 to 2022 for research, supervised by [Prof.Dr. Ren√© Algesheimer](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/market-research/teamoverview/tcurrent/algesheimer.html) and [Dr. Manuel Sebastian Mariani](https://www.business.uzh.ch/de/research/professorships/market-research/teamoverview/tcurrent/Mariani0.html). 

My research interests include collective intelligence, group decision making, collective behavior, human-algorithm interactions, and business intelligence. I have published 20 papers in leading journals and conference in the fields of management and information (google scholar:<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYjV6XIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). I am very keen to discuss with researchers from different fields. If there are potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to contact me!ü§ùü§ù
